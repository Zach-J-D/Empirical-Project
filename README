    - .git
    - myenv
    - PROJECT

        - wagegrowth.qmd
        - wagegrowth.pdf
        - requirements.txt
    - Blog.txt
    - README

Inside the PROJECT folder, there is the data used for the project inside 'Data', the source code is in wagegrowth.qmd, with a rendered output in wagegrowth.pdf. The requirements.txt file contains the necessary libraries to run the project.

The Blog.txt file contains links to the Github repository, and the hackmd blog post itself.

## Replicating the results

source myenv/bin/activate


PowerShell:
python -m venv myenv
.\myenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1


3. Install required Python packages

With the virtual environment activated, install the necessary libraries:
